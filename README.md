Hi,

I would like to show you a piece of my work.

This is a landing page of a digital contracts platform. I used HTML/CSS, SCSS, JS. Also, the layout is responsive with a burger menu and media queries.

Please, have a look at https://maria-khudolii.github.io/oneflow/ Thank you for your interest and time!

All the best wishes, Maria
